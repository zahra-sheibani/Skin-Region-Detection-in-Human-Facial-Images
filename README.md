# Skin-Region-Detection-in-Human-Facial-Images
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline designed to identify skin regions in human facial images using supervised classification techniques. The task was part of an academic assignment aimed at designing, implementing, and evaluating a predictive model for pixel-wise skin detection.\
The model is trained and tested on the WIDER FACE validation set, accessed via the Hugging Face Hub in Parquet format. Each record in the dataset includes:\
•	An image of a human face\
•	A label mask indicating which pixels correspond to skin

Pipeline Overview\
The pipeline consists of the following major components:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing\
•	Images are decoded from bytes using OpenCV.\
•	A series of image processing steps are applied:\
o	Gaussian Blur to reduce noise\
o	Color space transformation from BGR to HSV\
o	Edge detection using the Canny algorithm
2. Feature Extraction\
For each pixel in the image, a 9-dimensional feature vector is extracted:\
•	HSV color values: h, s, v\
•	Original RGB values: B, G, R\
•	Pixel position (normalized row/column indices)\
•	Edge intensity (Canny output)
3. Model Training and Evaluation\
Two classical machine learning models are trained:\
•	Decision Tree Classifier\
•	Random Forest Classifier\
Each model is trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%. Performance metrics include:\
•	Accuracy\
•	Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)\
•	Training and inference time
4. Skin Prediction Function\
A utility function predict_skin_regions is implemented to:\
•	Apply the preprocessing pipeline\
•	Extract features from a new image\
•	Predict pixel-wise skin labels\
•	Return a binary skin mask
5. Visualization\
A visualization module displays the original image alongside the predicted skin masks generated by both the Decision Tree and Random\ Forest models for qualitative assessment.\
*Notes*:\
•	The approach leverages classical ML instead of deep learning for interpretability and rapid iteration.\
•	Feature selection and image preprocessing are critical to performance.\
•	The project is structured to allow easy substitution of other classifiers (e.g., SVM, Gradient Boosting).
